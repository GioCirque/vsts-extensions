Mermaid diagrams embedded within markdown file rendering is handled via [marked](https://marked.js.org)

## Usage

Install this extension to your Azure DevOps Organization.

Choose any `Markdown` (`.md`) or `Mermaid` diagram (`.mmd`) file in your repo. The preview pane will show the rendered content of `Marked Mermaid`.

The extension leverages the latest `Mermaid` and `Marked` versions available from their CDN, so new features should be available as soon as they are released.
